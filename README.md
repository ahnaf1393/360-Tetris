# 360-Tetris

360-Tetris is the implementation of the classical game of Tetris using virtual reality. The Tetris bricks are spawned in the surrounding area of the player and the player interacts with the bricks using a controller. Like the classical Tetris, the goal of the game is to complete full lines of bricks and clear them. Four walls will surround the user and user has the option to play all four walls or only one.

The objective of this project is to collect the three degree of translational and three degree of rotational movement data from the controller. We decided to collect this data by creating 360-Tetris game as it provides an immersive experience as well as requires sufficient amount of controller movement.  

Further details of the project along with information about all the other group members of the project can be found in the following address: https://wiki.tum.de/display/infar/%5B19SS+-+MP%5D+360-Tetris
